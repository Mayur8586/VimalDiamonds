                                        have been around for billions of years, but only a few hundred years ago did man
                                        discover that an uncut diamond can be transformed into a faceted gem, and by
                                        doing so more light and beauty could be unleashed. This discovery lead to more
                                        diamond and shapes and cuts.</p>

                                        data-wow-delay="0.1s">Diamond shapes refer to the form or general outline of a
                                        diamond. It is not uncommon to confuse the ‘shape’ and ‘cut’ of a diamond, as
                                        they are considered to be synonyms, which is understandable because diamond
                                        “names” include the word cut, such as princess cut or emerald cut. However,
                                        there is a significant difference between the shape and cut of a diamond. Shape
                                        describes a diamond's form, symmetry and proportions (e.g. round, square,
                                        triangle) whereas cut refers to the specifications (e.g. ideal, excellent, very
                                        good) of a diamond.</p>
